# Sentiment_Analysis
The objective of this task is to build a machine learning model that can accurately detect hate speech.
Hate speech is defined as any tweet with a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it.
Given a dataset of tweets and their corresponding labels (0 for non-hate speech, 1 for hate
speech), the task is to predict the labels for a test dataset of tweets.
The goal of this project is to develop a classifier that can accurately distinguish between tweets
containing hate speech and those that do not. This model can be used to report tweets that could
be harmful or offensive, making the online community safer and more welcoming for everyone.
To solve this problem, we will use machine learning techniques. Metrics like accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1 score will be used to judge how well the model works.
